# Lua-ComputerCraft-Library

My own stab at writing Lua script for a turtle library in the computercraft mod for Minecraft: Java edition.
My first time trying out LUA Scripting, was rather easy to work with as most high-level interpretted languages are. May or may not finish it as usual just sharing it in case anything inside may be useful to others.
Copypasta code is sourced by links. Thanks to those coders who came before.
